"<p>The roots of the modern concept of statistical confidentiality in the US federal statistical system can be traced directly back to the late nineteenth century efforts of statisticians to ensure full and accurate responses by businesses to statistical inquiries.  Officials argued that such confidentiality guarantees were needed to ensure that the providers of enterprise and establishment data could be confident that the statistical agencies could not be forced to share their responses with others, such as regulatory or tax authorities, congressional investigators, prying journalists, and competitors, who might use this information to the detriment of the data provider.  Nevertheless, over the years, the principle of statistical confidentiality with respect to information provided by businesses in statistical inquiries has been repeatedly challenged by other executive branch departments, independent regulatory agencies, the courts, Congress, and members of the public, with quite varied results.</p>

<p>The paper uses the published record and archival research to examine the history of challenges to statistical confidentiality, and the responses of the statistical agencies, the federal statistical system as a whole, including the office of the chief statistician in OMB (and its predecessors), executive department and independent non-statistical agencies, the courts, and Congress as well as representatives of the business community.  Long-term trends and the implications for maintaining and strengthening the confidentiality protections for establishment- and enterprise-level business data provided to federal agencies for statistical purposes are discussed.</p>",html,,Margo J.

"In this paper, we survey the basic paradigms and notions of secure multiparty computation and discuss their relevance to the field of privacy-preserving data mining.  In addition to reviewing definitions and constructions for secure multiparty computation, we discuss the issue of efficiency and demonstrate the difficulties involved in constructing highly efficient protocols.  We also present common errors that are prevalent in the literature when secure multiparty computation techniques are applied to privacy-preserving data mining.  Finally, we discuss the relationship between secure multiparty computation and privacy-preserving data mining, and show which problems it solves and which problems it does not.",onep,"The research of the first author was supported by an Infrastructures grant from the Ministry of Science, Israel.

"To limit disclosures, statistical agencies and other data disseminators can release partially synthetic, public use microdata sets.  These comprise the units originally surveyed; but some collected values, for example, sensitive values at high risk of disclosure or values of key identifiers, are replaced with multiple draws from statistical models.  Because the original records are on the file, there remain risks of identifications.  In this paper, we describe how to evaluate identification disclosure risks in partially synthetic data, accounting for released information from the multiple datasets, the model used to generate synthetic values, and the approach used to select values to synthesize.  We illustrate the computations using the Survey of Youths in Custody.",onep,,Jerome P.

"When releasing microdata to the public, data disseminators typically alter the original data to protect the confidentiality of database subjects' identities and sensitive attributes.  However, such alteration negatively impacts the utility (quality) of the released data.  In this paper, we present quantitative measures of data utility for masked microdata, with the aim of improving disseminators' evaluations of competing masking strategies.  The measures, which are global in that they reflect similarities between the entire distributions of the original and released data, utilize empirical distribution estimation, cluster analysis, and propensity scores.  We evaluate the measures using both simulated and genuine data.  The results suggest that measures based on propensity score methods are the most promising for general use.",onep,"This research was supported by NSF grant EIAâ€“0131884 to the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS).
